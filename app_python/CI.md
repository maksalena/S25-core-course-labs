# CI Workflow Best Practices

## Workflow Optimization Strategies

1. **Use Caching**: The CI pipeline caches dependencies to speed up builds.
2. **Linting Before Testing**: Running `flake8` first ensures clean code.
3. **Parallel Jobs**: Running build & tests separately improves CI efficiency.
4. **Status Badges**: Workflow badges provide visibility.

## Docker Integration in CI

- The workflow logs into Docker Hub, builds an image, and pushes it.
- Uses `secrets` for Docker Hub credentials to enhance security.

## Improvements

- **Reduced workflow time** with caching.
- **Added vulnerability scanning** using Snyk.
